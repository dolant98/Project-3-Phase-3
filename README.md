### Substance Use Treatment Analysis
#### Key Determinants of Treatment Outcomes

## Overview
According the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), over 20 million people in the United States over the age of 12 had a substance use disorder 
(SUD)*. This is pre-pandemic and doesn't account for any increase due to the stressors of the past two years.  Effective SUD treatment not only addresses 
the substance use itself, but also socio economic factors which contribute to the SUD.
